Are sales trends for two industrial products related? The two time series objects described below contain Sales of chemicals and allied products; and Sales of motor vehicles and parts, in the U.S. for each month from Jan. 1971 to Dec. 1991. File is petr.txt. \\

\noindent You should analyze the data in the "chemicals" time series and the "vehicles" time series and write a report to address such questions as:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item What trend model(s) best capture the trends in sales of chemicals over time?
    \item What trend model(s) best capture the trends in sales of vehicles over time? Once the trend
has been accounted for, what can you say about the behavior of the detrended data, for both
models? Can either the original time series or the detrended series be described using any
common models?
    \item For the various models you tried, assess their fit. Can any transformations improve the
fit? Is there any apparent association between chemical sales and vehicle sales over time? If so,
describe the association.
    \item Make conclusions that relate to how the sales amounts (for both chemicals and vehicles)
change, both long-term over the observed period of years, and in terms of patterns of month-
to-month variation.
\end{enumerate}
